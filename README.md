# Pydantic-AI Weaviate Agent Application

This is a focused application that uses a **Pydantic-AI based Weaviate agent** for PV market analysis through vector database queries with **conversation memory**.

## üöÄ Features

### Pydantic-AI Weaviate Agent
- **Agent Type**: `pydantic_weaviate`
- **Technology Stack**: Pydantic-AI + Weaviate Vector Database
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Semantic search through Weaviate vector database
  - Natural language queries for PV market data
  - **Access to both historical and forecast data**
  - **Intelligent query reformulation** - translates user questions into specific Weaviate queries
  - Intelligent data retrieval and analysis
  - **Conversation memory across multiple queries**
  - Fallback mode when Weaviate is unavailable

## üß† Conversation Memory

### How It Works
The agent maintains conversation context using Pydantic-AI's built-in `message_history` feature:

- **Per-Conversation Memory**: Each conversation maintains its own message history
- **Context Awareness**: The agent can reference previous questions and build on conversation context
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory is cleared when conversations are deleted
- **Memory Monitoring**: Admin can monitor memory usage and active conversations

### Memory Features
- ‚úÖ **Context Retention**: Agent remembers previous questions in the same conversation
- ‚úÖ **Follow-up Queries**: Can answer questions like "How does this compare to France?"
- ‚úÖ **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and memory monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Conversation Isolation**: Each conversation has independent memory

## üìä Available Data Collections

The agent has access to two Weaviate collections:

1. **Market_historical_data**: Historical solar capacity installations and market data
2. **Market_most_probable_forecast**: Forecast data from 2025 to 2030 in the most probable scenario

Agent Reformulation: Multiple specific queries:
- "solar capacity installations in Italy for current period"
- "solar capacity installations in France for current period" 
- "solar capacity installations in Germany for current period"
- "forecasted solar capacity for Italy, France, and Germany for future years"
Weaviate Query: Multiple SQL translations to retrieve comprehensive data
```

### Conversation with Memory
```
User: "What is the solar capacity in Germany?"
Agent Reformulation: "solar capacity installations in Germany for recent years"
Agent: "Germany installed X GW of solar capacity in 2022..."

User: "What is the forecast for Germany in 2028?"
Agent Reformulation: "forecasted solar capacity for Germany in 2028"
Agent: "According to the most probable scenario, Germany is forecasted to reach Y GW by 2028..."

User: "How does the forecast compare to current capacity?"
Agent Reformulation: "compare current solar capacity with forecasted capacity for Germany"
Agent: "Based on the previous data, Germany's capacity is expected to grow from X GW to Y GW..."

User: "What about the growth rate in these countries?"
Agent Reformulation: "solar capacity growth trend in Germany from current to 2028"
Agent: "Based on the historical and forecast data, Germany's growth rate is..."
```

### Reformulation Guidelines
The agent follows specific guidelines for query reformulation:

- **Historical Data**: "solar capacity installations in [country] for [year]"
- **Forecast Data**: "forecasted solar capacity for [country] in [year]"
- **Comparisons**: "compare solar capacity between [country1] and [country2] for [year]"
- **Trends**: "solar capacity growth trend in [country] from [year1] to [year2]"
- **Always specifies**: Country, year, and data type (historical vs forecast)
