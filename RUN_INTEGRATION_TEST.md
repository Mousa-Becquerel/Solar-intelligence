# Running the Integration Test

The NumPy error you're seeing is an environment issue, not a problem with our refactored code. Here's how to test:

## Option 1: Run with Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
poetry run python test_refactored_integration.py
```

If you still get the NumPy error, you may need to rebuild your poetry environment:

```bash
poetry env remove python
poetry install
poetry run python test_refactored_integration.py
```

## Option 2: Test Without Matplotlib

I can create a simpler test that doesn't require matplotlib. This will test the core refactored backend without the chart dependencies.

## Option 3: Direct Browser Testing

Skip the automated tests and run the app directly:

```bash
poetry run python run_refactored.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser and test:
- Landing page
- Registration
- Login
- Chat interface (basic functionality)

## What We're Testing

The integration tests verify that:
1. ✅ App factory creates app successfully
2. ✅ Database models work with new app
3. ✅ Service layer integrates correctly
4. ✅ Routes are accessible
5. ✅ Templates render properly

Once these pass, you'll know the refactored backend works with your existing frontend!

## Need Help?

Let me know which option you'd like to try, or if you want me to create a matplotlib-free test script.
