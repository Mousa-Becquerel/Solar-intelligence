"""
Business logic services package.

This package contains all business logic, separated from route handlers.
Services are framework-agnostic and can work with both Flask and FastAPI.

Each service handles one domain area:
- auth_service: Authentication and authorization
- conversation_service: Conversation management
- agent_service: AI agent coordination
- admin_service: Admin operations
- export_service: Export functionality
